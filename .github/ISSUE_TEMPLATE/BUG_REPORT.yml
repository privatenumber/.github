        ## üìã Show us the bug

        > [!CAUTION]
        > Without proving the bug is in this project via *minimal* reproduction, your issue will be closed without response.

        The minimal reproduction is the core of your issue. This is usually all we read.

        The first thing we'll do is scrutinize every code, file, and dependency to see how they impact the bug. If you can delete it and still produce the bug, it's not needed.

        Upload your reproduction to [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) or a GitHub repository and use GitHub Actions to show the error.

        Please do your best to _show_ the bug rather than talking about it. This will lead to a speedy resolution.
