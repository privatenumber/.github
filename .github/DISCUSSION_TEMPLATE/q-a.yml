        ## ðŸ’¬ What's your question?

        1. **Keep it short:** Start with the question. The longer the text, the less reads it gets.
        2. **Write clearly:** Use a spelling & grammar checker, ChatGPT, etc.
        3. **Include context:** Attach code snippets, configurations, errors, and screenshots.
        4. **Proof-read:** Pretend you're a stranger online. Would you understand your question?
